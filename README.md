LEGO:registered: LOCO Alternate Installer
=========================================

An alternate installer for _LEGOÂ® LOCO_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer.

This project uses code from [bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [*Grim Fandango Setup*](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
to pull the files off the disc, modified by Triangle717 to support ANSI and Unicode Inno Setup.
